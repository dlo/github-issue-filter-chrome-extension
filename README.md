GitHub Issue Filter Saver
=========================

The [new GitHub issues](https://github.com/blog/1866-the-new-github-issues) is awesome, but unfortunately issue filters are no longer preserved when clicking on the "issues" icon on the right navigation. This extension saves the last filter you used and loads that instead of a blank slate every time you access the main issues page.

This extension is open source. If you encounter any bugs, don't hesitate to make a pull request or [file an issue](/issues).
